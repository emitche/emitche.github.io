		<dl class="services">
				<dt>Web Development</dt> 
				<dd><p>Though not new to web development, I am learning more about today's standards. It's important to stay informed about best practices and keep up with ever-changing technology. The web keeps getting smarter. And we should make intelligent decisions about the resources we use to communicate our message. Current things that make me happy: Sass, JavaScript, PHP, Responsive Design, Responsible Design, Content First.</p></dd>
			
				<dt>Drupal</dt> 
				<dd><p>I discovered <a href="https://drupal.org/about">Drupal</a> while looking for an inexpensive, customizable content management system. I was working at a nonprofit that needed a good media solution. I tried out WordPress and Joomla. And I fell in love with the community of people on Drupal and the many possibilities for customization. I built <a href="http://metroumc.org/">my first Drupal site</a> in 2011. (It's not pretty, but the content was key to the site.)</p>
				<p>I help out in the Drupal issue queues, specifically for the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/mediafront">MediaFront module</a>. As a developer, my goal is to learn how to build great code and to help people build and utilize great code.</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Writing</dt> 
				<dd>
				<p>Language (both written and spoken) connects people and has the potential to be powerful. I like when we say meaningful things. I believe we ought to care about what we write and say. I like editing words until they reach out to people in the best possible way. Whether I'm writing words for a site or editing my own poems, I enjoy the writing and editing process.</p>

<!-- Web Development: Front-End or Back-End -->
<aside class="dev">
	<h1 class="dev">Front-End or Back-End?</h1>
		<p>I'm an intermediate front-end and beginner back-end developer who appreciates the different components of web development.</p> 
		<p>You need both the front-end and back-end for a well-functioning web experience. They are integral to each other. Both involve a certain amount of design, ingenuity, and attention to usability. Both require a great deal of flexibility and creativity. I enjoy thinking about content and the framework for how that content is displayed. But I also enjoy thinking about how that content will be received. If I need to tell you something important but I don't present it clearly, you might be turned off or won't receive my message. If I've made a super fancy site that is a shell for not much, then I've wasted my time and yours. Content, design, and structure have to play and work well together. It's vital for web developers to appreciate all aspects of the web development process.</p>

<!-- About -->
<section class="about">
	
	<h1 class="about"><a id="whoiam">About</a></h1>

	<p>I grew up in Detroit, Michigan, attended Williams College in Massachusetts, and returned to southeast Michigan to make a difference. I've found that making a difference involves learning to do something well and contributing those skills back to the community. So I write and I code. I've been writing since I was a kid and building websites since I was a teen. I've spent the last year pursuing an arts degree in Creative Writing and am switching gears to pursue a career in web development. </p>
