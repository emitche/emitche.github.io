      <p>My name is Elizabeth and I don't like sharing much about myself. But... I thought of something I could share more freely and not be scared&mdash; music!</p>
      
      <p>I am an avid music listener. Here are some of my favorites.</p>

        <dd>A rock band whose Christian-inspired lyrics tend to be positive and uplifting. This band is unafraid to mix in different music styles. <em>Murdered Love</em> is my favorite album by this artist.</dd>

      <p>I've also been listening to a lot of different music lately. Here are some current artists and bands I have enjoyed:</p>
      
        <ul>
          <li>Explosions in the Sky</li>
          <li>Stars</li>
          <li>The Postal Service</li>
        </ul>
        
      <p>In the past year I've discovered that I really enjoy experimental/instrumental rock. The musicians do incredible things with their instruments. Consequently I've developed a greater appreciation for rock music, which it turns out I love though I didn't actually realize it.</p>
      
      <p>I believe that music, just as with other art forms, has the potential to connect people in beautiful ways. Musicians and songwriters have a great responsibility to produce meaningful, life-changing art. Some people create art without thinking about their responsibility to create something meaningful. I tend not to listen to those artists. There's too much music in the world not to seek out what's worth one's time and ear.</p>
