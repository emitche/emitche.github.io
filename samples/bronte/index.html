      Inspired by <a href="http://pemberley.com">The Republic of Pemeberley</a>, a home for Jane Austen fans, this site is for lovers of Charlotte Bront&euml; and her writing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you've ever found yourself reading through the pages of a C. Bront&euml;'s work, wishing you could talk to someone who is also familiar with Lucy Snowe, this place is for you. If you enjoy <em>Jane Eyre</em> and want a place to talk about it, you are welcome here. If you haven't heard much about Charlotte Bront&euml; and want to read her works, this place is also for you.
    </p>

      This site is provided as an example for <a href="http://emitche.github.io">Elizabeth Mitchell's portfolio</a>. But this may be an actual site in the future.

      <dd>There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.</dd>

      <dd>My godmother lived in a handsome house in the clean and ancient town of Bretton. Her husband's family had been residents there for generations, and bore, indeed, the name of their birthplace—Bretton of Bretton: whether by coincidence, or because some remote ancestor had been a personage of sufficient importance to leave his name to his neighbourhood, I know not.</dd>

      <dd>The other day, in looking over my papers, I found in my desk the following copy of a letter, sent by me a year since to an old school acquaintance.</dd>

      <dd>Of late years an abundant shower of curates has fallen upon the north of England: they lie very thick on the hills; every parish has one or more of them; they are young enough to be very active, and ought to be doing a great deal of good. But not of late years are we about to speak; we are going back to the beginning of this century: late years—present years are dusty, sunburnt, hot, arid; we will evade the noon, forget it in siesta, pass the midday in slumber, and dream of dawn.</dd>
