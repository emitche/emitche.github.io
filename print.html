        Beginning in late October 2013, I began researching mobile trends for 2014, collecting information about trends for mobile apps and the use of mobile devices.
        Results at Hand is a software company that builds mobile apps for associations. The research I collected was applied to associations and their specific needs.
        I conducted research, identified 10 trends with the help of the Results at Hand staff, and wrote the white paper.
        In addition to writing the white paper, I also designed the 16-page publication.

        The owner of the store had a powerful story, but needed help finding the right words to express this story.
        I helped her craft a bio about what made her business unique.

        The organization needed a new brochure. The new brochure highlighted the organization's offerings.
        I used a preexisting logo to guide the design of the brochure and collected images to include in the brochure.
        I contacted printing companies and selected a printing method that would be cost effective for the organization.

        In January 2011, I became the editor of the monthly newsletter for the organization.
        The newsletter began as a print newsletter. I edited the content, images, and created the print design
        for the print/electronic newsletter that was distributed in PDF and paper copy form.
        In the spring of 2012, the newsletter moved to an online version.
        I used hand-coded HTML to build the newsletter. Editing the the newsletter included copyediting and image editing.</p>

        While serving with City Year Detroit, I helped plan and run a youth service learning program.
        As a secondary responsibility, I had the opportunity to share our team's story throughout the year with the corporation sponsoring our team.
        I also edited the newsletters of the remaining 7 City Year Detroit teams and sent them out monthly to the foundations and sponsors who supported City Year Detroit.

        I created a 40-page document detailing the events the center supported and organized during the 2007-2008 school year.
        The report also included information on the college's history. Some of the content I wrote in the report and the images gathered
        are still used by the center on their website (<a href="https://davis-center.williams.edu/history/" target="_blank">the center's history</a>).
