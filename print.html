<h1>Print Design and Professional Writing</h1>

<p class="tagline">"Words are tools to communicate from one human heart to another."</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>

		<h3>Professional Writing</h3>

			<li>I have experience copyediting and editing content, preparing it for placement in publications and print materials.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Print Design</h3>
		<p>I enjoy using my photo editing skills and design eye to create text-based written materials that are enjoyable to read.</p>

		<h4>White Paper</h4>

				<dt>What:</dt>		<dd>Print Design, Writing, Editing, Photo Editing</dd>
				<dt>Client:</dt>	<dd>Results at Hand Software</dd>
			</dl>

			<p>Beginning in late October 2013, I began researching mobile trends for 2014, collecting information about trends for mobile apps and the use of mobile devices in 2014. Results at Hand is a software company that builds mobile apps for associations. The research I collected was applied to associations and their specific needs. I conducted research, identified 10 trends with the help of r@h staff, and wrote the white paper. In addition to writing the white paper, I also design the white paper and collected images to use in the white paper.</p>

			
		<h4>Brochure</h4>

			<dl class="">
				<dt>What:</dt> 			<dd>Print Design, Writing, Editing, Photo Editing</dd>
				<dt>Who:</dt> 			<dd>Metropolitan United Methodist Church</dd>    
				<dt>Download:</dt> 	<dd><a href="files/samples/MetroUMCBrochure.pdf">Brochure</a></dd>
			</dl>

			<p>The organization needed a new brochure. The new brochure highlighted the organization's offerings. I used a preexisting logo to guide the design of the brochure and collected images to include in the brochure. I contacted printing companies and selected a printing method that would be cost effective for the organization. Tools used in the project included Scribus and Gimp (open-source).</p>
			
		
		<h4>Newsletter</h4>
			
			<dl class="">
        <dt>What:</dt> Print Design, Editing, Photo Editing</dd>
        <dt>Who:</dt> Metropolitan United Methodist Church</dd>
        <dt>Downloads: <a href="files/samples/MetroUMCMessengerMay2011.pdf">May 2011 Newsletter</a>, </dd>
      </dl>
			
			<p>In January 2011, I became the editor of the monthly newsletter for the organization. The newsletter began as a print newsletter. I edited the content, images, and created the print design for the print/electronic newsletter that was distributed in PDF and paper copy form. In the spring of 2012, the newsletter moved to an online version. I used hand-coded HTML to build the newsletter. Throughout my time editing the journal, copyediting and image editing were constants.</p>
