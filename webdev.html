	<h2>What I Do</h2>
	
	<p>I build websites and web apps in a front-end development capacity, which means I deal with the content and visual representation of content on a site. I care about responsive design and accessibility. People should be able to view a site cleanly no matter what device they are using to access the information they are receiving. I support open source and free software and try to contribute to open source projects when I can.</p>

        <dt>Tools I Use</dt>
        <dd>Responsive design, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Compass, jQuery, JavaScript, Drupal, WordPress, Git, Gimp</dd>

        <dt>What I'm Currently Learning and Building:</dt>

     </dl>
		 
	<p>My goal is to become a T-shaped developer, learning design, front-end, and backend development, though there are sometimes I feel more like a T-rex. I love technology and learning about how it can be used to communicate clearly and effectively to other human beings.</p>

	<h2>How I Got Started</h2>
	
	<p>I started building sites as a kid. In college, I took a course on web development and loved it, but opted not to take more computer science courses. Instead, I majored in American Studies and learned about communities and good literature. I used every chance I could get to build websites. During college and after college, much of my work involved print design. In 2009, I started working at a nonprofit in Detroit where my primary responsibility involved communications materials, including administering the website. I dived into open-source content management systems and Drupal as a way to better meet the nonprofit's website needs. Through that experience, I had the chance to work a lot with Drupal. I love building web experiences and am constantly pushing myself to be a stronger software craftsman.</p>

	<h2>Some of My Work</h2>
    
      <dl>
        <dt>Screen Emulator</dt>
        <dd>What: Design, Development</dd>
        <dd>Site: <a href="http://emitche.github.io/screenemulator/">Screen Emulator</a></dd>
        <dd>Tools Used: JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS</dd>
        <dd><p>I built a responsive design testing tool for people building websites and web apps. In the summer of 2013, I looked online for responsive design tools that were free and easy to use but didn't find any helpful resources. (I've since encountered many great responsive design tools which are listed in the resources on the screen emulator.) In the fall of 2013, while taking a front-end development class, I decided to build a tool for responsive design and development that allows individuals to view actual size of the screens they are building sites for (if they are using a desktop or laptop). The tool works on mobile devices as well. I got a lot of help from the friendly people at Atomic Object Detroit. I'm still working on the project.</p></dd>

        <dd><p>I updated the visual interface and design for a pre-existing application. I worked one-on-one with the back-end developer to improve the user experience. I used a modular approach in designing and developing the interface and cleaned up the front-end code.</p></dd>

        <dd>Tools Used: CSS, HTML
        <dd><p>Each year, the literary journal hosts a conference. The conference site used image-based navigation and was fixed-width. I took the preexisting inline CSS styles and converted them to an external stylesheet. I accounted for accessibility and responsiveness in my adjustments to the theme, which allowed the pages to be viewed more easily on different types of devices. I also cleaned up the code.</p></dd>

          <dd><p>Each time the literary journal is released, the site theme is updated to reflect the cover art of the most recent journal. Using the cover artwork to inform the design, the theme was updated for 33.1 (Fall 2012) and 33.2 (Spring 2013).</p></dd>

        <dd>Who: Metropolitan United Methodist Church</dd>
        <dd><p>I worked at a nonprofit and we needed a few things to have a better functioning site including a better video solution and a blog. I moved the site from a church-focused content management system (CMS) to more affordable hosting and a custom CMS solution. I tried out Joomla and WordPress, but Drupal was a good choice because it had great video options for our needs. I built and configured the site and maintained the site for about 2 years including backing up the site, updating Drupal core and modules, and writing and adding pages, blogs posts, and videos.</p></dd>
